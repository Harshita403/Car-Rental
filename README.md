# 🚗 Car Rental System (Java OOPs)

A robust command-line interface (CLI) application built using **Java** to manage car rentals. This project focuses on implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** principles to handle car inventory, customer data, and booking transactions.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Car Inventory Management:** View available cars with their specifications and rental rates.
- **Customer Registration:** Capture customer details for every booking.
- **Dynamic Billing:** Automatically calculate the total cost based on the number of days.
- **Availability Logic:** Prevents double-booking of cars that are already rented.
- **CLI Interface:** Easy-to-use terminal-based navigation.

## 🧱 OOPs Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation:** Used private fields and public getters/setters to protect car and customer data.
- **Inheritance:** Leveraged a base `Vehicle` class (if applicable) for different car types.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex rental logic and showing only necessary methods.
- **Collections:** Used `ArrayList` to manage the fleet of cars and customer records.
